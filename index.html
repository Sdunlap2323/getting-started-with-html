  <h2>Lesson 1: Notes</h2>
  <h3>WWW. Or World Wide Web: How the Web works</h3>
  <p>The <b>Web</b>, as it is commonly called, is made up of over 30 billion pages that can and do interact with each other, like a spider’s web, thus the name. Your <b>Browser</b> on your computer, such as <em>Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Chrome</em>, request information from the internet using the protocol <b>HTTP</b>, which is in turn linked to <b>Servers </b>(specially formatted and optimized computers designed to store information) that relay this information back to your browser. Your browser then interprets the info and displays it on your screen.</p>

  <h3>HTML Or Hyper Text Markup Language</h3>
  <p><em><b>HTML</b></em> is the main document type used on the web; some call the heart of the web. HTML is made up of text, markup, references, and links. The text refers to the content of the page. Markup is made up of Tags that tell your page what it is supposed to look like. HTML also involves references to other documents, images, and video, as well as links to these references and other websites.</p> 
  <h3>Tags, Elements, and Attributes</h3>
  <em><b>-Tags</b></em>: The Markup section of HTML is made up of Tags and a Tag is contained in a set of brackets. These tags give instructions to the content that make up your web page. Most Tags usually have an opening and closing, but Void Tags are the exception, and they do not have a closing Tag.<br>
  <em><b>-Elements</b></em>: Elements are the Tag itself and contents within the Tag.<br>
  <em><b>-Attributes</b></em>: Attributes are properties of an HTML Element, contained within the Tag.
  <h3>Why Computers Are Stupid</h3>
<p>Computers are literal machines; they do exactly what they are told to do. They do not extrapolate what you might have been trying to accomplish, or fill in the blanks if you make a mistake. You have to enter your commands exactly, using correct “syntax”, to get your machine to do what it is supposed to. This literal thinking is why programmers call computers stupid.</p>
  <h3>Inline vs Block</h3>
  <em><b>Inline Tags</b></em>: work like the name sounds; they work within your text and other within Elements.<br>
  <br>
  <em><b>Block Tags</b></em>: defines a section; it creates an invisible box around your content. So the browser will display a line break before and after a Block Element.
